### Hello! My name's Kevin üë®üèª‚Äçüíª 

I am optimistic about the possibilities of applied mathematics, particularly machine learning, to inform debate and serve the public good. I currently work as a programmer at Princeton University in the [Center for Digital Humanities](https://github.com/Princeton-CDH/), helping professors and students develop their data-driven research projects. Before Princeton, I worked in the energy sector, building machine learning models that increase efficiency on the electrical grid.

#### ‚ö° The Energy Sector

I've built multiple energy grid models with the Open Modeling Framework ([dpinney/omf](https://github.com/dpinney/omf)), an open-source project that‚Äîthrough partnerships with national labs and the Department of Energy‚Äîdevelops online tools for electric utilities. Partnered with the OMF, I also studied how deep learning can be used to predict energy consumption, a suprisingly under-researched field. Increasingly accurate energy predictions can help utilities with peak shaving, a process where small mistakes can cost tens of thousands of dollars.

#### üé® Art & Machine Learning:

With the Center for Digital Humanities, I'm researching how machine learning will challenge what we value in art and studying how automation can be used as a source of inspiration. Check out my first project, [kmcelwee/mondrianify](https://github.com/kmcelwee/mondrianify) that uses edge-detection to transform images into paintings by Piet Mondrian.

### Reach out!

I'm always open to helping organizations and journalists with their technical projects! Since starting my work at Princeton, I've had less time for freelance work, but I'm still doing business as Brown Analytics, LLC. I'm also actively looking for opportunities to volunteer my technical skills to non-profits supporting LGBT rights üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà
