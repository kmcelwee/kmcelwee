### Hello! My name's Kevin üë®üèª‚Äçüíª 

I earned a degree in Music at Princeton in 2018 and soon after discovered programming through data journalism. For two years, I worked for electric utilities, buiding models that increase efficiency on the grid; then for two years, I returned to Princeton as a programmer on staff, writing software for professors and students. I moved to Boston in 2022 and now work at AWS, helping build a cloud-based file system called FSx.

#### ‚ö° The Energy Sector

Partnered with [rural utilities](https://www.electric.coop/), national labs, and the Department of Energy, I studied how deep learning can be used to predict energy consumption. Increasingly accurate energy predictions can help utilities save a lot of money through a process called "peak shaving." [Read about my deep learning research](https://www.kmcelwee.com/load-forecasting/).

After utilities showed more interest in my research, I partnered with Burt County Public Power and NRECA to build a web app that automatically draws in weather data and load data every day to generate a forecast. [Check out the product we built.](https://coopforecast.com/)
