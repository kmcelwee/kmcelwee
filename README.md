### Hello! My name's Kevin üë®üèª‚Äçüíª 

I'm moving to Boston soon, and after getting settled, I plan to start looking for my next job in August 2022!

I am optimistic about the possibilities of applied mathematics, particularly machine learning, to educate, inspire, and serve the public good. I've been a machine learning and research software engineer for about four years. I just finished work as a programmer at Princeton University in the [Center for Digital Humanities](https://github.com/Princeton-CDH/), helping professors and students develop their data-driven research projects. Before Princeton, I worked in the energy sector, building machine learning models that increase efficiency on the electrical grid.

#### ‚ö° The Energy Sector

Partnered with [rural utilities](https://www.electric.coop/), national labs, and the Department of Energy, I studied how deep learning can be used to predict energy consumption. Increasingly accurate energy predictions can help utilities save a lot of money through a process called "peak shaving." [Read about my deep learning research](https://www.kmcelwee.com/load-forecasting/).

After utilities showed more interest in my research, I partnered with Burt County Public Power and NRECA to build a web app that automatically draws in weather data and load data every day to generate a forecast. [Check out the product we built.](https://coopforecast.com/)
